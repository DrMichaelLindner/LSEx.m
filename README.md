##   Lindenmayer system Explorer for Matlab

This GUI based toolbox is designed to either generate new or modify existing Lindenmayer systems/grammars. 

*Lindenmayer System Generator:*    
Using the Generator you can generate predefined Lindenmayer systems (e.g. Fibonacci) or you can define your own rules to create grammars. 

*Lindenmayer System Modifier:*    
Using the Modifier you can change and modify existing L-systems, by 
building rules to iteratively replace chains of n characters of the 
system with chains of m other ones. 
    
See detailed description about the usage in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LSEx/LSEx.m/wiki), 
in the User Manual (pdf), by using the help buttons on the GUI or by 
using the "help" or "doc" function in Matlab.
